# Atomic-Physics-Senior-Thesis

  This is my senior thesis for my Bachelor of Science in Physics at the University of North Texas. The theoretical/computational atomic physics thesis was six credit hours over the course of two semesters. Elastic, momentum, and differential cross sections, which relate to the probability of a collision event occurring, of various atomic systems involving electrons, positrons, positronium, helium, and hydrogen were analyzed and compared. Data needed for the calculations were aggregated from several sources and then compared through graphing. All results were obtained via Python using data science libraries such as scipy, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. All code was written by me.
